A hundred and a night, leading you to build up a picture of science and technology

## Introduction

This series introduces how stuffs in science and technology works. Things includes science like physics, engineering like computer, technology like artificial intelligence, and more. Mainly writing for people majored in the general arts.

I am going to write a post everyday. Hopefully keep writing for more than a hundred of night, and so called the book name.

The book is for the purpose of preparing TOEFL and therefore without pretty English as yet.
